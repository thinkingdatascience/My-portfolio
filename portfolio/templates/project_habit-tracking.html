                    With over two decades of experience in the banking industry, my focus has been on International
                    Trade Finance
                    operations. As a Certified Documentary Credit Specialist (CDCS), I possess a wealth of knowledge on
                    trade instruments
                    and have an exceptional eye for technical detail. I understand the importance of working in a highly
                    regulated
                    environment and ensuring documentation is checked to the highest standards within agreed timescales.
                    My customer-focused
                    approach and excellent communication skills make me an approachable and efficient team player,
                    delivering first-class
                    customer service.

                    In addition to my extensive banking experience, I have taken it upon myself to learn Python
                    Programming Language, Data
                    Science, and Artificial Intelligence, which I am deeply passionate about. I share my insights and
                    expertise on my
                    recently launched YouTube channel, which you can access via the provided handle. Through my
                    experience, I have observed
                    communication gaps between Banking Operations and AI Automation teams. My dual expertise enables me
                    to bridge these gaps
                    effectively. I am eager to bring my skills and experience to the table, and I am confident I can
                    contribute to the
                    team's success.
